    h2 Microsoft
    h3 Principal Design Manager, Developer Division
    p I'm currently managing a team of 12 individual contributors across the the US and Europe, designing the developer experience for the #[i Visual Studio] family of code editing tools at Microsoft in Seattle.
    p Initially brought into the team for my design systems expertise, my role expanded to lead a group of design technologists, building out prototypes, Figma extensions and open-source tooling to help bridge the gap between design and engineering teams.

    p During the course of 2017, I managed a team of 8 individual contributors across Redmond, Raleigh and Hyderabad for the Developer Services group at Microsoft, building out experiences for distributed development teams that relied on the collaborative Azure DevOps suite; including work item tracking, repository management, component governance and other enterprise-scale features.

    p In this role, I initiated the usage of Figma#[+sidenote("sn-figma", "Within the team at Figma, I'm infamously known as Patient Zero.")] across Microsoft, including speaking and sharing best practices at internal events, and ultimately facilitating over 4,000 editors within the Developer Division, Dynamics, Microsoft 365, Windows, and Azure product teams to move to one centralised design tool.
